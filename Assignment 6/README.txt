Hi Professor,

I have tried to execute this CUDA assignment. This is my first experience in CUDA, but i have tried to solve it. 

I have created one global cuda function, In that i am calculating (checking minimum distance value) value for row and column of matrix (a[i][k] and a[k][j]). 

In Main method, I am using 'rand()' method to generate random matrix data. And, then store in Cuda variable which i used in my global function. I used 'threadsPerBlock' method to assign thread count for each block and used 'numBlocks' method for assigning block count. And, then call global function for calculating.

Thanks for gving us such precious assignment.
