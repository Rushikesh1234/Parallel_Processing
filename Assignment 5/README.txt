Hi Professor,

I have tried to solve solution at my level. I tried my best to find solution.

I have divided input array element among all processor. So, Each proessor will work on each element of Input array. Then, pass element value to calclForce function for calculation.

Then, In CalcForce function, i am calculating force value from 0 to i position for each processor. And, Broadcast them to all processor for keeping them update.

And, in last, I am printing those force value (F Array) at the end when PID =0.

I have tried to get some soluion. This problem is so confusing and difficult to think for me. I hope this solution will work.
